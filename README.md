# Barlukova
Barlukova and Rouzine 2020, the software code for Figs 2 and 3.

We separated the code into 4 parts corresponding to each figure. 

To generate a plot from the evolution code for one parameter set, you need to run the file generate_curve_from_figure_{figure number}.m

You will also find the final figures (corr. to different parameter sets in one figure) in .fig format for Figs 2a-e, 2f, 3a.

To get Fig 3b in .fig format, there is file plot_3b.m. You just need to run it.
